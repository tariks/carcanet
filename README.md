##  Overview

Written with the jewelry industry in mind, glyptic leverages advanced image processing and generative AI techniques to prepare fingerprint images suitable for jewelry engraving. A two-step process starts by utilizing a pre-trained U-Net model to enhance and denoise raw dactylograms. The second step automates an SDXL-based workflow transforming enhanced images to high-resolution, stylized vector art in SVG format, ensuring compatibility and scalability. Glyptic includes a streamlined setup process that can be deployed on a cloud or local install, and can comfortably run on an M1 Macbook. By generating beautiful yet faithful outputs for even low-quality fingerprints, glyptic significantly benefits the jewelry engraving industry.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | Glyptic follows a modular architecture with a focus on image processing and machine learning, specifically for enhancing fingerprint images using a U-Net model, and image-to-image translation using ComfyUI, SDXL, and controlnet |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | Glyptic follows a structured and organized style with clear separation of concerns, such as modular functions for specific tasks like setup, image enhancement, and image transformation. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include ComfyUI, JuggernautXL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Hub, along with image processing libraries like OpenCV, scikit-image, and Pillow. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase is highly modular, with distinct modules for different functionalities such as image enhancement, setup, and workflow management, promoting reusability. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Glyptic can both be scaled to run on high-end cloud servers | and run on local machines, with the ability to process large batches of images efficiently. End-to-end processing takes about one minute per image on an M1 macbook with 32GB of RAM. 
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | The project relies on several key dependencies including TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Pillow, and various other libraries for machine learning and image processing. |
| üöÄ | **Simplicity**   | Glyptic wraps up the entire process in a single command, providing a one-click solution out of the box. |
